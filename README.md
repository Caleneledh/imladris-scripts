#  PREAMBLE
#
#################################################################################

This started as a personal repository for the various scripts and functions that
I have written over time.  I like to make incremental backups of files whenever
they need editing, as it is sometime useful to refer to older version to under-
stand the evolution of a script when working on it.

It doesn't take long to accrue a rather large collection of said backups, and
rooting through all those copies takes way to long.  In an effort to reduce the
size of my scripts compost heap I decided to store them in a git repository;
that way I can refer back to older copies, and maybe other people can make use
as well.



#
#  NOTICES
#
#################################################################################

Most of the scripts here will be written for zsh.  They may need editing to 
function correctly in other shells.

Also note that I have Prezto installed so there may be references to Prezto
functions and aliases.

All these scripts have been written on an up-to-date Arch linux install so some
scripts will be Arch specific.
